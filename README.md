# Binary Transparency log for https://f-droid.org

This is a log of the signed app index downloaded from
https://f-droid.org/repo/index.jar This is stored in a git repo, which
serves as an imperfect append-only storage mechanism.  People can then
check that any file that they received from that F-Droid repository
was a publicly released file.

It was gathered using a script in a crontab on a random Debian box on
the internet.  Then once `fdroid btlog` became available, the data was
since generated using `fdroid btlog` on a more suitable random Debian
box on the internet.
